****
### Overall, the mmYodar project includes four parts: <br> 1.mmWave Signal Pre-processing Process <br> 2.Real-time System <br> 3.Camera and mmWave multimodal Dataset <br> 4.Object Detection Network.
****
### 1.The mmWave signal pre-processing process of mmYodar is demonstrated in *Radar_points_image* folder.<br>
### Please `run GetFiles.m` to get radar points images which are the input of detection network. More details can be found in code.<br><br>
### Using your own mmWave binary files requires a deep understanding of mmWave data transmission and reception. Many parameters in the processing program need to be carefully modified accordingly.
### Therefore, we provide pre-collected usable mmWave files. Baidu Netdisk: <br>https://pan.baidu.com/s/13XubeLqVNEAWVo74W8ct9A?pwd=ZXCV Extracted codeï¼šZXCV

### 2.The real-time system of mmYodar is demonstrated in *OnlineSystem* folder.<br>
### Please `run test.py` for visual results. After initialization, you need to press the button *DCA1000ARM* and *Trigger frame* orderly. <br>
### Noted: Online system require installing  [mmWave studio software](https://www.ti.com/tool/MMWAVE-STUDIO). Of course, you should have a mmwave radar.

### 3.The part of Camera and mmWave multimodal Dataset is demonstrated in *Dataset* folder. For privacy and security, please contact for a complete dataset greenthunder@stu.xjtu.edu.cn.<br>
### Please `run test.py` for visual results. After initialization, you need to press the button *DCA1000ARM* and *Trigger frame* orderly. <br>
### Noted: Online system require installing  [mmWave studio software](https://www.ti.com/tool/MMWAVE-STUDIO). Of course, you should have a mmwave radar.
