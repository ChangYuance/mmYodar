### The mmWave signal pre-processing process of mmyodar is demonstrated in *Radar_points_image* folder.<br>
### Please use the main fuction GetFiles.m to get radar points images which are the input of detection network. More details can be found in code.<br><br>
### Using your own mmWave binary files requires a deep understanding of mmWave data transmission and reception.Many parameters in the processing program need to be carefully modified accordingly.
### Therefore, we provide pre-collected usable mmWave files.Baidu Netdisk:https://pan.baidu.com/s/13XubeLqVNEAWVo74W8ct9A?pwd=ZXCV Extracted codeï¼šZXCV
