****
## Overall, the mmYodar project includes four parts: ***mmWave Signal Pre-processing Process***, ***Real-time System***, ***Camera and mmWave multimodal Dataset*** and ***Object Detection Network***.
****
### The mmWave signal pre-processing process of mmYodar is demonstrated in *Radar_points_image* folder.<br>
### Please use the main fuction GetFiles.m to get radar points images which are the input of detection network. More details can be found in code.<br><br>
### Using your own mmWave binary files requires a deep understanding of mmWave data transmission and reception.Many parameters in the processing program need to be carefully modified accordingly.
### Therefore, we provide pre-collected usable mmWave files.Baidu Netdisk:https://pan.baidu.com/s/13XubeLqVNEAWVo74W8ct9A?pwd=ZXCV Extracted codeï¼šZXCV

### The real-time system of mmYodar is demonstrated in *OnlineSystem* folder.<br>
### Please run the test.py for visual results. After initialization, you need to press the button *DCA1000ARM* and *Trigger frame* orderly. <br>
### Noted: Online system require installing mmWave studio software [Ti](link:https://www.ti.com/tool/MMWAVE-STUDIO). Of course, you do need to have a mmwave radar.
